< h1 >< em >Thankfulness and Warm Tidings Abound< /em >< /h1 >

As we delve into the fall season, we rapidly approach one of my favorite holidays: Thanksgiving! An occasion teeming with feasts and gratitude, I look forward to celebrating the event with my friends and family. 

< h2 >"I'm Thankful For..."< /h2 >
Here are a few reasons why I love Thanksgiving:

< h3 >Self-Reflection and Gratitude < /h3 >
The holiday encourages me to look back on the year and take stock of everything that has happened. While negative moments inevitably happen, I am reminded of the support and love I have received. Little moments that I took for granted come to mind. That warmth provides a fresh perspective that motivates me through the next year.

< h3 >Season of Giving< /h3 >
This time of thankfulness and self-reflection leads many people to acts of generosity and volunteering in their communities. People are often kinder to one another. While these acts are appreciated in any season, seeing an influx at this time of year is refreshing.

< h3 >...And of course, the Food < /h3 >
Along with gratitude and generosity, the food is incredible. I anticipate having too much pumpkin pie, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. While I enjoy the traditional Thanksgiving meal, the point is to enjoy a great meal with loved ones.  

< h2 >Spend Time With Loved Ones< /h2 >
Thanksgiving is an event that focuses on having thankfulness and cherishing your loved ones, These are just a few reasons why I look forward to it every year. Whether traditional or unconventional, I hope many people will experience the love and gratitude associated with this holiday.
